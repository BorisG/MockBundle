# MockBundle
An utility class to mock a Bundle

Put MockBundle.kt in your src/test/java path (classic util folder or wherever you have all your magic tricks).

I've just mocked some of the gets/puts for the types I needed for the app I am currently working on, but feel free to implement them for all the types you need.
